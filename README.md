# Data Analytics project 2
 <h3>This is a real life data analytics task including presentation to clients </h3>
 </br>
Client background: 
</br>
<p>Socail Buzz emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, 
only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can 
react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments. 
This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user 
feeds. 
 <br>
Over the past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month. 
They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee 
their scaling process effectively. 
Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they 
create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging 
from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted. All of this data is highly unstructured and 
requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain. Out of the 
250 people working at Social Buzz, 200 of them are technical staff working on maintaining this 
highly complex technology. </p>
